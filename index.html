            My name is Emily Jena, from South Africa. I appreciate the nature that is usually around me when we travel.
             I like eating desserts for breakfast, but I am trying to change that habit. Whilst I was on my mission in Ghana, Accra, 
             I learned how to make art with beads, and that is my current favorite thing to work on.
