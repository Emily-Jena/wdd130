            My name is Emily Jena, from South Africa. I appreciate the nature that is usually around me when we travel.
             I like eating desserts for breakfast, but I am trying to change that habit. Whilst I was on my mission in Ghana, Accra, 
             I learned how to make art with beads, and that is my current favorite thing to work on.

            <img src="images/south_africa.PNG" alt="A South African Flag">
            <p>South Africa really is many worlds in one. Expect stunning coastlines, dramatic mountainscapes, huge areas of untamed bushveld, starkly beautiful semi-deserts, lakes, waterfalls, spectacular canyons, forests and wide plains, plus Cape Town, undeniably one of the most beautiful cities in the world.</p>
